        <h1>All About Calla!</h1>
        <h5>Sorry to fool you with the images above. Those aren't not really me. That's my dog, Ollie, the St. Johns bridge by my house, and my cat Daisy. They are just a lot more fun to put on a portfolio than an image of me.</h5>
        <h5>Let me give you some insight on who I really am.</h5>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>I have about >5% experience with programming. The closest thing I have is getting fancy with my Myspace and Xanga pages in 2005. It was fun to make those cool background and font styles! I think I had the collect pages. Anyways, I studied Hospitality Admin in college and have worked in Hotel Operations for almost ten years. It was super fun, but it can be exhausting open up new hotels or working through property renovations. I learned a lot, but ultimately realized that it's not worth it to sacrifice a quality work/life balance while never getting ahead on my mortgage. The life of programming seems to have much more opportunity, as well as an adequate salary and benefits. I'd like to take care of my future while I still have a chance to be selfish! Thus, Epicodus. I'm looking forward to my future career and the opportunity to open up a whole new network of friends and experiences.</p>

            <p>As far as my hobbies, it's been a slow road building those. The life of a Hotel Manager essentially meant my hobbies were taking care of my department at work, rather than finding out what I like to do for fun. I am <strong>absolutely</strong> a workaholic! However, I do enjoy checking out shows at local venues in Portland. A lot of amazing musicians come here... definitely more than they do in Buffalo where I'm from! I also enjoy checking out different trails to hike through around Portland. I haven't taken Ollie on any long-distance hikes yet, but maybe someday. I have a cat named Daisy, who I flew across the country after I had already relocated here. She never wants to fly again. I own a condo in St. Johns, and enjoy fixing it up in my free time. I've done some interior painting and decorating, and spruced up the patio with plants and decor. It's my private oasis.</p>

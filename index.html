        <h1>All About Calla!</h1>
        <h5>Sorry to fool you with the images above. Those aren't really me. That's my dog, Ollie, the St. Johns bridge by my house, and my cat Daisy. They are just a lot more fun to put on a portfolio than an image of me.</h5>
        <p>Let me give you some <strong>insight</strong> on <span class="highlight">who I really am</span>.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <ol>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <li>I have about >5% experience with programming. The closest thing I have is getting fancy with my Myspace and Xanga pages in 2005. It was fun to make those cool background and font styles! I think I had the coolest pages. Anyways, I studied Hospitality Admin in college and have worked in Hotel Operations for almost ten years. It was super fun, but it can be exhausting to open up new hotels or work through property renovations. I learned a lot, but ultimately realized that it's not worth it to sacrifice a quality work/life balance and never get ahead on my mortgage. The life of programming seems to have much more opportunity, as well as the possibility of working somewhere fun! I'd like to take care of my future while I still have a chance to be selfish! Thus, Epicodus. I'm looking forward to my future career and the opportunity to open up a whole new network of friends and experiences.</li> <br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <li>As far as my hobbies, it's been a slow road building those. The life of a Hotel Manager essentially meant spending time at work, rather than finding out what I like to do for fun. I am <strong>absolutely</strong> a workaholic! However, I do enjoy checking out shows in Portland. A lot of amazing musicians come here... definitely more than they do in Buffalo where I'm from! I also enjoy checking out different trails to hike throughout the Pacific Northwest. I haven't taken Ollie on any long-distance hikes yet, but maybe someday. My cat Daisy flew across the country when I moved here. She never wants to fly again. I own a condo in St. Johns, and enjoy fixing it up in my free time. I've done some interior painting and decorating, and spruced up the patio with plants and decor. It's my private oasis. I have a feeling I'll be able to discover some more hobbies as I enter the world of Web Development.</li>

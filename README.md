# _Calla's Intro Portfolio_

#### _Git, HTML and CSS Independent Assignment for Epicodus, 05.26.2017_

#### By _**Calla Rudolph**_

## Description

_This HTML webpage is my first independent project at Epicodus. I created it using all of the knowledge I had gained after one short week of class. It includes of summary of projects I created within the first week of school. It also lists a brief description of myself and my professional background._

_The page includes quite a few elements of styling within CSS and Bootstrap. For the header, I've included a sidebar image, along with a well which includes a header, unordered list, and three images. I've included a panel that lists out projects I have worked on as well, as their Github repo links and brief descriptions. Finally, I've included an additional well on the bottom to list out some information about me in an ordered list._

_Some of the CSS styling for div classes include margin and padding settings, borders, background images for the page and one well, a class just for a highlight of text, and a media query for when the size of the page is reduced._
